### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
 
The first time I completed the app, my poster image was not showing up correctly, it looked like a minuscule square in the top left corner  of the screen. When I went to look at its attributes, everything was fine so I didn't understand what the issue was. The code also seemed to be correct. I resolved the issue by deleting the Image View and creating one identical to the original image and when I ran the application, everything was fine. I'm not sure if that is just an issue with my Android Studio or if there's a better way to solve these issues.
